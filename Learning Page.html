  <div id="demo" class="collapse"><br>
    If you don’t earn much and you can barely pay your bills, the idea of saving money might seem laughable. When you only have R100 left at the end of the month, why even bother to try saving? Because everyone has to start somewhere, and if you work at it, your financial situation is likely to improve over time. Saving money is worth the effort. It gives you peace of mind, it gives you options, and the more you save, the easier it becomes to accumulate additional savings. <br>

  <div id="demo1" class="collapse"><br>
    RA, or retirement annuity, is usually the terminology used for the accumulation of retirement funds—in other words you save into a retirement annuity while you are working. When you retire from the fund, two-thirds of the retirement annuity must be used to purchase an annuity, which will pay you an income in retirement. With a fixed annuity (or life annuity) your lump sum buys you a set income. It all depends on the type of annuity you purchase as to when it will stop paying out. The two most common are a single life annuity and a joint life annuity.<br>

  <div id="demo2" class="collapse"><br>
    An emergency fund is an account for funds set aside in case of the event of a personal financial dilemma, such as the loss of a job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home. The purpose of the fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net of funds that can be used to meet emergency expenses as well as reduce the need to draw from high-interest debt options, such as credit cards or unsecured loans. An emergency fund should contain enough money to cover at least three months of income, according to most financial planners. Note that financial institutions do not carry accounts labeled as emergency funds. Rather, the onus falls on an individual to set up this type of account and earmark it as capital reserved for personal financial crises. ﻿An emergency fund is a financial security for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses. Financial planners recommend that emergency funds should typically have 3 to 6 months' worth of income in very liquid form so that it is instantly accessible. Use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up your fund.<br>

  <div id="demo3" class="collapse"><br>
    There are many benefits of having a good credit score, such as enjoying a lower interest rate on your credit cards and loans. A good credit score also allows you to save money on insurance and security deposits on new utilities and cell phone service. Using your credit wisely and responsibly is what helps you to maintain a good score. The more you know about what goes into your credit score, the easier it will be to maintain a good one. Five key pieces of information are used to calculate your credit score—your payment history, level of debt, credit age, mix of credit, and recent credit. Some things do not affect your credit score. For example, checking account overdrafts and utility payments won’t automatically help (or hurt) your credit score.<br>

  <div id="demo4" class="collapse"><br>
    Budgeting is the process of designing, implementing and operating budgets. It is the managerial process of budget planning and preparation, budgetary control and the related procedures. Budgeting is the highest level of accounting in terms of future which indicates a definite course of action and not merely reporting. It is an integral part of such managerial policies as long-range planning, cash flow, capital expenditure and project management. It must be remembered that budgeting is not forecasting. It is true that budgeting does involve some sort of forecasting particularly in the area of sales budget. But the process is physically one of detailed analyses and planning not merely prognosticating future results. Forecasting is a process of predicting the future state of world, in connection with those aspects of the world which are relevant to and likely to affect on future activities.<br>
